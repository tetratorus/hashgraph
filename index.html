  <h1>Hashgraph Consensus</h1>
  <p>An introduction to hashgraph consensus by Stefan Buhrmester</p>
  <h2>What is Hashgraph Consensus?</h2>
  <p>
    First conceived by Leemon Baird, the hashgraph consensus algorithm is a generic algorithm that runs on connected nodes of a distributed system and maintains a
    consensus over the correct order of events that occur among the nodes that make up the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is particularily useful for the operation of distributed systems that need to operate on a globally agreed
    state, such as log replication, distributed ledgers or shared databases.
  </p>
  <p>
    It operates without leader election, is optionally byzantine, runs in a dynamic environment, and depending on implementation can be very bandwidth-efficient.
